# Test-the-Law-Of-Large-Numbers-for-N-random-normally-distributed-numbers
The Law of Large Numbers states that the sample mean of an independent and identically distributed sequence of random variables approaches its expected value as the sample size increases. It's usually denoted as "LLN". To test this phenomenon using Python, we are asking to generate a program that randomly generates N values drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. These values must then be checked against the condition -1 <= x <= 1. If true, that particular value would get counted into a counter. After counting all the values, this counter divided by N gives us what percentage of the data lies inside the interval we want. Since 68.2% of the generated data falls under the interval, our goal is to create an algorithm which does exactly that. Once completed, our next objective is to increase N, run it again, and verify it comes close enough to 68.2%. Finally, we can make sure the program calculates the average value of all the iterations, which, theoretically, approaches 68.2%` too because of LLN.
